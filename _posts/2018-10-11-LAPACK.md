>Instruction for using LAPACK in c on Linux.

## Installation
* Install BLAS
     * Download latest version from [http://www.netlib.org/blas/](URL 'http://www.netlib.org/blas/').  
     * Untar   
     * `$cd BLAS-*/`  
     * `$make`  
     * get lib `blas*.a`  
* Download latest version from [http://www.netlib.org/lapack/](URL 'http://www.netlib.org/lapack/').
* Untar
* `$cd lapack-*/`
* `$cp make.inc.example make.inc` and change line 81 to point to `blas*.a`
* `$make lib`
* `$make lapackelib`
* `$make cblaslib`
* Move files in `LAPACKE/include/` and `CBLAS/include/` to some `include/` you are familiar with. 
* Move 'lapacke', 'lapack', 'blas', 'cblas' librarys to some `lib/` you are familiar with, and rename them as `liblapacke.a`, `liblapack.a`, `libblas.a`, `libcblas.a`.

## Test
* Get test program from [http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.html](URL 'http://www.netlib.org/lapack/lapacke.html').
* Compile with `$gcc test_lapack.c -L lib/ -llapacke -llapack -lcblas -lblas -lgfortran -lm -I include/ -o test_lapack` 
      
## Documentation
* [http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/index.html](URL 'http://www.netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/index.html')
* This documentation have specific defination for all lapack functions. But, if you want to use some function `f()` in lapack, you should use `LAPACKE_f()` or `cblas_f()`, you can see parameters of `LAPACKE_f()` or `cblas_f()` in this documentation as well, but there are no details. 

## Functions
`#include <lapacke.h>`for lapacke functions, `#include <cblas.h>`for cblas functions  
### cblas_dtrsm  
`void cblas_dtrsm (const CBLAS_LAYOUT layout, const CBLAS_SIDE Side, const CBLAS_UPLO Uplo, const CBLAS_TRANSPOSE TransA, const CBLAS_DIAG Diag, const int M, const int N, const double alpha, const double \*A, const int lda, double \*B, const int ldb)`   
- `layout`: `CblasRowMajor` or `CblasRowMajor`   
- `Side`: `CblasLeft` or `CblasRight`, same meaning as `SIDE` in `dtrsm()`  
- `Uplo`: `CblasLower` or `CblasUpper`, same meaning as `UPLO` in `dtrsm()`  
- `TransA`: `CblasNoTrans` or `CblasTrans`, same meaning as `TRANSA` in `dtrsm()`  
- `Diag`: `CblasNonUnit` or `CblasUnit`, same meaning as `DIAG` in `dtrsm()`  
- `alpha`: same meaning as `ALPHA` in `dtrsm()`  
- `A`: same meaning as `A` in `dtrsm()`  
- `B`: same meaning as `B` in `dtrsm()`  
If you are using `CblasRowMajor`, and `A` is a square matrix:  
- `M`: length of each edge of `A`  
- `N`: number of columns in `B`  
- `LDA`: the same as `M`  
- `LDB`: the same as `N`  

## FAQ
### What is LDA? 
([http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1897](URL 'http://icl.cs.utk.edu/lapack-forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=1897'))  
> On LDA, the doc says:
> - LDA (input) INTEGER  
> - The leading dimension of the array A. LDA >= max(1,N).  
>
> Now N is the number of columns in the input matrix. But the input matrix is symmetric, so we'd expect it to be N x N, right? In that case LDA = N. The ">=" part in the comment just allows for the possibility that the input matrix A is in fact part of a larger array, with a greater number of rows than are actually used in this function. But unless you're doing something tricksy, "LDA" is just the rows of A, and equals N.  
  
  Understunding of mine: While storing a matrix `A` in memory, the jth element of ith row `A[i][j]` can also be `A[i*n+j]`, which means the (i\*n+j)th element in `A`, where `n` is the number of elements in each row. However, while you are using part of a matrix to compute, for example part of `A`, `A'`, `A'[i][j]` is the (i\*n+j)th element of `A'`, but `n` is no longer the number of elements in each row of `A'`. As a result, you need to tell the computer `A'` is part of a larger matrix `A` using `LDA=n`.   
    
  In conclution, `LDA` is the number of elements in each row of the matrix you stored in memory.
